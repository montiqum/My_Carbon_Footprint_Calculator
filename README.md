# My Carbon Footprint Calculator


My Carbon Footprint Calculator is a resource available to the average everyday person to help them calculate their estimated carbon footprint, 
and keep them informed on ways to help reduce carbon emissions. 
It is intended to bring awareness to household members on the effects of carbon emissions on the atmosphere, and climate. 
By changing our diet, recycling habits, and energy usage, everyone can effectively make a difference.
