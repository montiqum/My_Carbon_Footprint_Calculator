# Final Project Review

An overview of building a web application from scratch. My trials and tribulations learning ASP.NET and creating a web application called My Carbon Footprint Calculator that uses the users input to calculate their estimated carbon footprint and provides suggestions and links to further information on how users can reduce their carbon footprints.

## Review

### 1. Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)
[Details](https://github.com/montiqum/My_Carbon_Footprint_Calculator#my-carbon-footprint-calculator)

### 2. Code and architecture walk-through
[Code](https://github.com/montiqum/My_Carbon_Footprint_Calculator/tree/main/Code)
I used some of every component taught in the course including:
- C#
- SQL
- ASP.NET
- HTML
- CSS
- LINQ
- APIs
- Azure

### 3. Product demonstration

### 4. Lessons learned:

#### - What did you do right?
I included every aspect of what was taught in the course.

#### - What did you do wrong?
Almost everything. It was a whole learning experience, even the C#.

#### - Where were you lucky?
I was lucky to have people to help me through this cohort. I feel like everyone was good at something, and where they were weak another individual was strong in the area. I think this definitely demonstrated team work and showed that everyone brings something to the table.

#### - What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
I would definitely change these Model names in my project. I wish we could do a deeper dive into APIs, and I wish the Cohort was a tad bit longer. I one day hope to be a proficient full stack developer and that's my focus.
